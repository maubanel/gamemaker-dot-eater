# Dot Eater

This started off as a summer camp exercise.  The game was far too much for what the students could implement but I wanted to go as far as I had time to in Game Maker studio 2 to implement a fairly faithful facsimile to the original game.  I based the logic off of **The Pac Man Dossier** in [Gamasutra](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3938/the_pacman_dossier.php?print=1).  


It is missing:

1.  Elroy functionality in Blinky
2.  Fruit
3.  Timer when player doesn't eat dots to send out next ghost
4.  Full audio
5.  Begining and end screens
6.  Gamemakers random number for calculating ghost's frightened turns as opposed to original
7.  Flashing tiles at end of level
8.  Multiplayer
9.  Score is simplistic
10.  No high score
